# 🏭 NPRI - National Pollutant Release Inventory Dataset

This project involves the exploration, cleaning, and analysis of data from the **National Pollutant Release Inventory (NPRI)**. The NPRI is Canada’s public inventory of pollutant releases, disposals, and transfers, helping ensure transparency and environmental accountability.

## 📊 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to:

- Understand the structure and content of the NPRI dataset
- Clean and preprocess the data for analysis
- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Visualize trends in pollutant releases over time
- Identify major contributors and pollutants by sector and region

## 🗃️ Dataset

The data used in this project is sourced from the official Government of Canada website:

- **Source**: [Environment Climate Change Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change.html)

The dataset includes information on:

- Facility names and locations
- Types of pollutants released
- Quantities of pollutants
- Methods of disposal or treatment

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Git / GitHub

## 📈 Key Findings

- The top 5 pollutants by volume released in the past decade
- Provinces with the highest pollution levels
- Trends over time in key industries such as oil & gas, mining, and manufacturing

## 📂 Project Structure
- Disposals and Releases Dataset Cleaning
- Merging
- Feature Engineering
- Feature Selection
- Model Training and Evaluation
