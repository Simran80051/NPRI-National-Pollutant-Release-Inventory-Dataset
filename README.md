# NPRI-National-Pollutant-Release-Inventory-Dataset

# 🏭 NPRI - National Pollutant Release Inventory Dataset

This project involves the exploration, cleaning, and analysis of data from the **National Pollutant Release Inventory (NPRI)**. The NPRI is Canada’s public inventory of pollutant releases, disposals, and transfers, helping ensure transparency and environmental accountability.

## 📊 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to:

- Understand the structure and content of the NPRI dataset
- Clean and preprocess the data for analysis
- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Visualize trends in pollutant releases over time
- Identify major contributors and pollutants by sector and region

## 🗃️ Dataset

The data used in this project is sourced from the official Government of Canada website:

- **Source**: [Canada Open Data Portal - NPRI](https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/3ef7df7e-7806-4149-832d-c0c44b7b7465)

The dataset includes information on:

- Facility names and locations
- Types of pollutants released
- Quantities of pollutants
- Methods of disposal or treatment

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Git / GitHub

## 📈 Key Findings

- The top 5 pollutants by volume released in the past decade
- Provinces with the highest pollution levels
- Trends over time in key industries such as oil & gas, mining, and manufacturing
